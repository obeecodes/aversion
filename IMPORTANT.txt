You may experience a segfault or failed assertion in specific cases:

When performing a MOVE_INTENT, if the entity does not have a collider component, 
then obviously getEntityIndex will fail because it is trying to retrieve the index 
of the component that the entity DOES NOT HAVE!!! 

HANDLE THE ABOVE CASE GRACEFULLY
